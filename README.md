Easily create dynamic menus from within your Laravel 5 application.

Caffeinated Menus is originally based off of Lavary's [Laravel Menu](https://github.com/lavary/laravel-menu) package with support for the Caffeinated Shinobi package. For a more robust and complete package, please go check out [Laravel Menu](https://github.com/lavary/laravel-menu)!

The package follows the FIG standards PSR-1, PSR-2, and PSR-4 to ensure a high level of interoperability between shared PHP code. At the moment the package is not unit tested, but is planned to be covered later down the road.

Quick Installation

Once this operation is complete, simply add the service provider class and facade alias to your project's `config/app.php` file:

#### Service Provider
```php
Caffeinated\Menus\MenusServiceProvider::class,
```

#### Facade
```php
'Menu' => Caffeinated\Menus\Facades\Menu::class,
```

And that's it! With your coffee in reach, start building out some awesome menus!
